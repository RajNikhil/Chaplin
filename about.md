Hi! My name is <span class="highlight-span">Ankit Sultana</span>

I am a sophomore at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India. 
I like solving problems, learning new Algorithms and Data Structures and learning about Web Technologies. 
I like contributing to Open Source and writing nifty scripts to automate mundane tasks. 

> Above all, I love programming.

I occasionally [blog](http://bk2dcradle.github.io/) as well.
