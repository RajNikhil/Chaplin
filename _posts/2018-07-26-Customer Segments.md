Welcome to the third project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!

In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  

>**Note:** Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the **Shift + Enter** keyboard shortcut. In addition, Markdown cells can be edited by typically double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode.

## Getting Started

In this project, you will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in *monetary units*) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.

The dataset for this project can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers). For the purposes of this project, the features `'Channel'` and `'Region'` will be excluded in the analysis â€” with focus instead on the six product categories recorded for customers.

Run the code block below to load the wholesale customers dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported.


```python
# Import libraries necessary for this project
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display # Allows the use of display() for DataFrames

# Import supplementary visualizations code visuals.py
import visuals as vs

# Pretty display for notebooks
%matplotlib inline

# Load the wholesale customers dataset
try:
    data = pd.read_csv("customers.csv")
    data.drop(['Region', 'Channel'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
    print("Wholesale customers dataset has {} samples with {} features each.".format(*data.shape))
except:
    print("Dataset could not be loaded. Is the dataset missing?")
```

    Wholesale customers dataset has 440 samples with 6 features each.
    

## Data Exploration
In this section, you will begin exploring the data through visualizations and code to understand how each feature is related to the others. You will observe a statistical description of the dataset, consider the relevance of each feature, and select a few sample data points from the dataset which you will track through the course of this project.

Run the code block below to observe a statistical description of the dataset. Note that the dataset is composed of six important product categories: **'Fresh'**, **'Milk'**, **'Grocery'**, **'Frozen'**, **'Detergents_Paper'**, and **'Delicatessen'**. Consider what each category represents in terms of products you could purchase.


```python
# Display a description of the dataset
display(data.describe())
```

### Implementation: Selecting Samples
To get a better understanding of the customers and how their data will transform through the analysis, it would be best to select a few sample data points and explore them in more detail. In the code block below, add **three** indices of your choice to the `indices` list which will represent the customers to track. It is suggested to try different sets of samples until you obtain customers that vary significantly from one another.


```python
# TODO: Select three indices of your choice you wish to sample from the dataset
indices = [241,56,369]

# Create a DataFrame of the chosen samples
samples = pd.DataFrame(data.loc[indices], columns = data.keys()).reset_index(drop = True)
print("Chosen samples of wholesale customers dataset:")
display(samples)
```

    Chosen samples of wholesale customers dataset:

### Question 1
Consider the total purchase cost of each product category and the statistical description of the dataset above for your sample customers.  

* What kind of establishment (customer) could each of the three samples you've chosen represent?

**Hint:** Examples of establishments include places like markets, cafes, delis, wholesale retailers, among many others. Avoid using names for establishments, such as saying *"McDonalds"* when describing a sample customer as a restaurant. You can use the mean values for reference to compare your samples with. The mean values are as follows:

* Fresh: 12000.2977
* Milk: 5796.2
* Grocery: 3071.9
* Detergents_paper: 2881.4
* Delicatessen: 1524.8

Knowing this, how do your samples compare? Does that help in driving your insight into what kind of establishments they might be? 


**Answer:**
Looking at the sample customer spending and he average spending for each product category the first customer could be a retailer since they spend a lot on Fresh, Grocery and Frozen. 

The second customer could be a restaurant given their high spending on Milk, Grocery and Detergents_Paper category. 

The third customer is slightly similar to the first customer albeit on a smaller scale so may be this customer is not located in highly populated area or is just a small business.

### Implementation: Feature Relevance
One interesting thought to consider is if one (or more) of the six product categories is actually relevant for understanding customer purchasing. That is to say, is it possible to determine whether customers purchasing some amount of one category of products will necessarily purchase some proportional amount of another category of products? We can make this determination quite easily by training a supervised regression learner on a subset of the data with one feature removed, and then score how well that model can predict the removed feature.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign `new_data` a copy of the data by removing a feature of your choice using the `DataFrame.drop` function.
 - Use `sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split` to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Use the removed feature as your target label. Set a `test_size` of `0.25` and set a `random_state`.
 - Import a decision tree regressor, set a `random_state`, and fit the learner to the training data.
 - Report the prediction score of the testing set using the regressor's `score` function.


```python
# TODO: Make a copy of the DataFrame, using the 'drop' function to drop the given feature
new_data = data[['Fresh','Milk','Grocery','Frozen','Delicatessen']]

# TODO: Split the data into training and testing sets(0.25) using the given feature as the target
# Set a random state.
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(new_data, data['Detergents_Paper'], test_size=0.25, 
                                                    random_state=57)

# TODO: Create a decision tree regressor and fit it to the training set
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=35)
reg=regressor.fit(X_train,y_train)

# TODO: Report the score of the prediction using the testing set
score = reg.score(X_test,y_test)
```

### Question 2

* Which feature did you attempt to predict? 
* What was the reported prediction score? 
* Is this feature necessary for identifying customers' spending habits?

**Hint:** The coefficient of determination, `R^2`, is scored between 0 and 1, with 1 being a perfect fit. A negative `R^2` implies the model fails to fit the data. If you get a low score for a particular feature, that lends us to beleive that that feature point is hard to predict using the other features, thereby making it an important feature to consider when considering relevance.

**Answer:**
I tried to predict the value of Detergents_Paper category. The prediction score was 0.687. This feature is actually helpful in determining if a customer is solely a food related business or not since a high purchase of this category may indicate it is more of convenience store.

### Visualize Feature Distributions
To get a better understanding of the dataset, we can construct a scatter matrix of each of the six product features present in the data. If you found that the feature you attempted to predict above is relevant for identifying a specific customer, then the scatter matrix below may not show any correlation between that feature and the others. Conversely, if you believe that feature is not relevant for identifying a specific customer, the scatter matrix might show a correlation between that feature and another feature in the data. Run the code block below to produce a scatter matrix.


```python
# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of features in the data
pd.scatter_matrix(data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');
```

### Question 3
* Using the scatter matrix as a reference, discuss the distribution of the dataset, specifically talk about the normality, outliers, large number of data points near 0 among others. If you need to sepearate out some of the plots individually to further accentuate your point, you may do so as well.
* Are there any pairs of features which exhibit some degree of correlation? 
* Does this confirm or deny your suspicions about the relevance of the feature you attempted to predict? 
* How is the data for those features distributed?

**Hint:** Is the data normally distributed? Where do most of the data points lie? You can use [corr()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html) to get the feature correlations and then visualize them using a [heatmap](http://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html) (the data that would be fed into the heatmap would be the correlation values, for eg: `data.corr()`) to gain further insight.

**Answer:**
From the scatter plot above, it is clear that the data is right skewed due to presence of large number of outliers.

Detergents_Paper and Grocery, Milk and Grocery, and Detergents_Paper and Milk are three most correlated features and this fact can be noticed in both the scatter plot and the correlation table.

Since Detergents_Paper is one of the most correlated features it may not have been the best feature to use to cluster customers.


## Data Preprocessing
In this section, you will preprocess the data to create a better representation of customers by performing a scaling on the data and detecting (and optionally removing) outliers. Preprocessing data is often times a critical step in assuring that results you obtain from your analysis are significant and meaningful.

### Implementation: Feature Scaling
If data is not normally distributed, especially if the mean and median vary significantly (indicating a large skew), it is most [often appropriate](http://econbrowser.com/archives/2014/02/use-of-logarithms-in-economics) to apply a non-linear scaling â€” particularly for financial data. One way to achieve this scaling is by using a [Box-Cox test](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html), which calculates the best power transformation of the data that reduces skewness. A simpler approach which can work in most cases would be applying the natural logarithm.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign a copy of the data to `log_data` after applying logarithmic scaling. Use the `np.log` function for this.
 - Assign a copy of the sample data to `log_samples` after applying logarithmic scaling. Again, use `np.log`.


```python
# TODO: Scale the data using the natural logarithm
log_data = np.log(data)

# TODO: Scale the sample data using the natural logarithm
log_samples = np.log(samples)

# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of newly-transformed features
pd.scatter_matrix(log_data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');
```

![png](https://github.com/RajNikhil/dataBlog/blob/gh-pages/assets/CustomerSegmentation/custSeg_22_1.png?raw=true)


### Observation
After applying a natural logarithm scaling to the data, the distribution of each feature should appear much more normal. For any pairs of features you may have identified earlier as being correlated, observe here whether that correlation is still present (and whether it is now stronger or weaker than before).

Run the code below to see how the sample data has changed after having the natural logarithm applied to it.


```python
# Display the log-transformed sample data
display(log_samples)
```

### Implementation: Outlier Detection
Detecting outliers in the data is extremely important in the data preprocessing step of any analysis. The presence of outliers can often skew results which take into consideration these data points. There are many "rules of thumb" for what constitutes an outlier in a dataset. Here, we will use [Tukey's Method for identfying outliers](http://datapigtechnologies.com/blog/index.php/highlighting-outliers-in-your-data-with-the-tukey-method/): An *outlier step* is calculated as 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR). A data point with a feature that is beyond an outlier step outside of the IQR for that feature is considered abnormal.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign the value of the 25th percentile for the given feature to `Q1`. Use `np.percentile` for this.
 - Assign the value of the 75th percentile for the given feature to `Q3`. Again, use `np.percentile`.
 - Assign the calculation of an outlier step for the given feature to `step`.
 - Optionally remove data points from the dataset by adding indices to the `outliers` list.

**NOTE:** If you choose to remove any outliers, ensure that the sample data does not contain any of these points!  
Once you have performed this implementation, the dataset will be stored in the variable `good_data`.


```python
# For each feature find the data points with extreme high or low values
for feature in log_data.keys():
    
    # TODO: Calculate Q1 (25th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q1 = np.percentile(log_data,25)
    
    # TODO: Calculate Q3 (75th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q3 = np.percentile(log_data,75)
    
    # TODO: Use the interquartile range to calculate an outlier step (1.5 times the interquartile range)
    step = 1.5*(Q3-Q1)
    
    # Display the outliers
    print("Data points considered outliers for the feature '{}':".format(feature))
    display(log_data[~((log_data[feature] >= Q1 - step) & (log_data[feature] <= Q3 + step))])
    
# OPTIONAL: Select the indices for data points you wish to remove
outliers  = [66,338,75,142,154]

# Remove the outliers, if any were specified
good_data = log_data.drop(log_data.index[outliers]).reset_index(drop = True)
```

### Question 4
* Are there any data points considered outliers for more than one feature based on the definition above? 
* Should these data points be removed from the dataset? 
* If any data points were added to the `outliers` list to be removed, explain why.

** Hint: ** If you have datapoints that are outliers in multiple categories think about why that may be and if they warrant removal. Also note how k-means is affected by outliers and whether or not this plays a factor in your analysis of whether or not to remove them.

**Answer:**

There are five records that are considered outliers based on the condition defined above. These are:
1. 66
2. 75
3. 338
4. 142
5. 154

These customers should be removed from the dataset used to cluster the customers as otherwise it will distort the clusters despite not being representative of most customers.

## Feature Transformation
In this section you will use principal component analysis (PCA) to draw conclusions about the underlying structure of the wholesale customer data. Since using PCA on a dataset calculates the dimensions which best maximize variance, we will find which compound combinations of features best describe customers.

### Implementation: PCA

Now that the data has been scaled to a more normal distribution and has had any necessary outliers removed, we can now apply PCA to the `good_data` to discover which dimensions about the data best maximize the variance of features involved. In addition to finding these dimensions, PCA will also report the *explained variance ratio* of each dimension â€” how much variance within the data is explained by that dimension alone. Note that a component (dimension) from PCA can be considered a new "feature" of the space, however it is a composition of the original features present in the data.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Import `sklearn.decomposition.PCA` and assign the results of fitting PCA in six dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
 - Apply a PCA transformation of `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.


```python
# TODO: Apply PCA by fitting the good data with the same number of dimensions as features
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=6)
pca=pca.fit(good_data)

# TODO: Transform log_samples using the PCA fit above
pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples)

# Generate PCA results plot
pca_results = vs.pca_results(good_data, pca)
```

### Question 5

* How much variance in the data is explained* **in total** *by the first and second principal component? 
* How much variance in the data is explained by the first four principal components? 
* Using the visualization provided above, talk about each dimension and the cumulative variance explained by each, stressing upon which features are well represented by each dimension(both in terms of positive and negative variance explained). Discuss what the first four dimensions best represent in terms of customer spending.

**Hint:** A positive increase in a specific dimension corresponds with an *increase* of the *positive-weighted* features and a *decrease* of the *negative-weighted* features. The rate of increase or decrease is based on the individual feature weights.

**Answer:**

The first two principal components explain about 72% of the variance in the dataset. 

The first principal component explains about 44% of the variance,
The second principal component explains about 28% of the variance,
The third principal component explains about 12% of the variance, and
The fourth principal component explains about 10% of the variance.
In total, they explain 93.14% of total variance

Exploration of Principal Components:

PC1. First principal component is most correlated with Milk, Grocery and Detergents_Paper. Interestingly these three features are the most correlated as observed in the previous step. This dimension best represents retail goods.

PC2. Second principal component is most correlated with Fresh, Frozen and Delictassen features. This dimension best represents Foods.

PC3. Third principal component is most correlated with Fresh and Delictassen, where Fresh experiences large decrease in spending on Delictassen increases. This dimension best represents perishable foods.

PC4. Fourth principal component is most correlated with Frozen, Fresh and Delictassen, where Fresh and Delictassen decrease with increase in spending on Frozen. This dimension best respresents processed foods.

PC5. Fifth principal component is most correlated with Milk and Detergents_Paper, where spending on Detergents_Paper decreases with increase in Milk. This principal component explains 4.6% of the variance.

PC6: Sixth principal componen is Grocery and Milk, where spending on milk decreases with increase in spending on Grocery. This principal component explains 1.94% of the variance.

### Observation
Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it in six dimensions. Observe the numerical value for the first four dimensions of the sample points. Consider if this is consistent with your initial interpretation of the sample points.

display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = pca_results.index.values))

### Implementation: Dimensionality Reduction
When using principal component analysis, one of the main goals is to reduce the dimensionality of the data â€” in effect, reducing the complexity of the problem. Dimensionality reduction comes at a cost: Fewer dimensions used implies less of the total variance in the data is being explained. Because of this, the *cumulative explained variance ratio* is extremely important for knowing how many dimensions are necessary for the problem. Additionally, if a signifiant amount of variance is explained by only two or three dimensions, the reduced data can be visualized afterwards.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign the results of fitting PCA in two dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
 - Apply a PCA transformation of `good_data` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `reduced_data`.
 - Apply a PCA transformation of `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.


```python
# TODO: Apply PCA by fitting the good data with only two dimensions
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca = pca.fit(good_data)

# TODO: Transform the good data using the PCA fit above
reduced_data = pca.transform(good_data)

# TODO: Transform log_samples using the PCA fit above
pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples)

# Create a DataFrame for the reduced data
reduced_data = pd.DataFrame(reduced_data, columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2'])
```

### Observation
Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it using only two dimensions. Observe how the values for the first two dimensions remains unchanged when compared to a PCA transformation in six dimensions.


```python
# Display sample log-data after applying PCA transformation in two dimensions
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2']))
```

## Visualizing a Biplot
A biplot is a scatterplot where each data point is represented by its scores along the principal components. The axes are the principal components (in this case `Dimension 1` and `Dimension 2`). In addition, the biplot shows the projection of the original features along the components. A biplot can help us interpret the reduced dimensions of the data, and discover relationships between the principal components and original features.

Run the code cell below to produce a biplot of the reduced-dimension data.


```python
# Create a biplot
vs.biplot(good_data, reduced_data, pca)
```

### Observation

Once we have the original feature projections (in red), it is easier to interpret the relative position of each data point in the scatterplot. For instance, a point the lower right corner of the figure will likely correspond to a customer that spends a lot on `'Milk'`, `'Grocery'` and `'Detergents_Paper'`, but not so much on the other product categories. 

From the biplot, which of the original features are most strongly correlated with the first component? What about those that are associated with the second component? Do these observations agree with the pca_results plot you obtained earlier?

## Clustering

In this section, you will choose to use either a K-Means clustering algorithm or a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm to identify the various customer segments hidden in the data. You will then recover specific data points from the clusters to understand their significance by transforming them back into their original dimension and scale. 

### Question 6

* What are the advantages to using a K-Means clustering algorithm? 
* What are the advantages to using a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm? 
* Given your observations about the wholesale customer data so far, which of the two algorithms will you use and why?

** Hint: ** Think about the differences between hard clustering and soft clustering and which would be appropriate for our dataset.

**Answer:**

##### K-Means Clustering
In K-Means clustering, points in the same cluster to each and farther from those in other clusters.

Advantages:
1. It is easier to understand.
2. Highly scalable
3. Works well in real world as it is a general purpose clustering

##### Gaussian Mixture Model
In GMM clustering, clustering is based on probability of a point belonging to a cluster. This would mean a point could belong to more than one cluster but with varying probability.

Advantages:
1. Among mixture models GMM is the fastest algorithm.[1]
2. GMM is a probabilistic clustering therefore it doesn't have to force a point to be part of one cluster. 
3. Depending on the distribution of the data we have some flexibility to convey to the algorithm what the shape of the cluster would be like using covariance type parameter.

*References:*
1. [http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html#mixture](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html#mixture)

Given the distribution of points in the PC represented above, I belive GMM would be a better algorithm to cluster customers than K-Means.

### Implementation: Creating Clusters
Depending on the problem, the number of clusters that you expect to be in the data may already be known. When the number of clusters is not known *a priori*, there is no guarantee that a given number of clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure exists in the data â€” if any. However, we can quantify the "goodness" of a clustering by calculating each data point's *silhouette coefficient*. The [silhouette coefficient](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html) for a data point measures how similar it is to its assigned cluster from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (similar). Calculating the *mean* silhouette coefficient provides for a simple scoring method of a given clustering.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Fit a clustering algorithm to the `reduced_data` and assign it to `clusterer`.
 - Predict the cluster for each data point in `reduced_data` using `clusterer.predict` and assign them to `preds`.
 - Find the cluster centers using the algorithm's respective attribute and assign them to `centers`.
 - Predict the cluster for each sample data point in `pca_samples` and assign them `sample_preds`.
 - Import `sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score` and calculate the silhouette score of `reduced_data` against `preds`.
   - Assign the silhouette score to `score` and print the result.


```python
# TODO: Apply your clustering algorithm of choice to the reduced data 
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
clusters=[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
def kmcl(n_cluster):
    clusterer = KMeans(n_clusters=n_cluster, n_init=20, max_iter=300)
    # TODO: Predict the cluster for each data point
    preds = clusterer.fit_predict(reduced_data)
    
    # TODO: Find the cluster centers
    centers = clusterer.cluster_centers_
    
    # TODO: Predict the cluster for each transformed sample data point
    sample_preds = clusterer.predict(pca_samples)
    
    # TODO: Calculate the mean silhouette coefficient for the number of clusters chosen
    
    score = silhouette_score(reduced_data,preds)
    print('No of Clusters: ' +str(n_cluster)+' and silhouette score: '+str(score))
    
for i in clusters:
    kmcl(i)
```

    No of Clusters: 2 and silhouette score: 0.425377185098
    No of Clusters: 3 and silhouette score: 0.398737297578
    No of Clusters: 4 and silhouette score: 0.333934123735
    No of Clusters: 5 and silhouette score: 0.351631433158
    No of Clusters: 6 and silhouette score: 0.364818562581
    No of Clusters: 7 and silhouette score: 0.368088277909
    No of Clusters: 8 and silhouette score: 0.365547700145
    No of Clusters: 9 and silhouette score: 0.364255307683
    No of Clusters: 10 and silhouette score: 0.347166964575
    


```python
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture
#def gmmcl(n_cluster):
#    gmmclusterer = GaussianMixture(n_components=n_cluster, covariance_type='full', n_init=20, init_params='kmeans').fit(
#        reduced_data)
#    preds = gmmclusterer.predict(reduced_data)
#    centers = gmmclusterer.means_
#    gmmsample_preds = gmmclusterer.predict(pca_samples)
#    gmmscore = silhouette_score(reduced_data,preds)
#    print('No of Clusters: ' +str(n_cluster)+' and silhouette score: '+str(gmmscore))

#for i in clusters:
 #   gmmcl(i)

#gmmcl(3)

clusterer = GaussianMixture(n_components=3, covariance_type='full', n_init=20, init_params='kmeans').fit(
    reduced_data)
preds = clusterer.predict(reduced_data)
centers = clusterer.means_
sample_preds = clusterer.predict(pca_samples)
score = silhouette_score(reduced_data,preds)
print('No of Clusters: ' +str(3)+' and silhouette score: '+str(score))
```

    No of Clusters: 3 and silhouette score: 0.389356198403
    

### Question 7

* Report the silhouette score for several cluster numbers you tried. 
* Of these, which number of clusters has the best silhouette score?

**Answer:**
Cluster numbers and corresponding silhouette score from Gaussian Mixture Models
1. No of Clusters: 2 and silhouette score: 0.409968324528
2. No of Clusters: 3 and silhouette score: 0.422312511126
3. No of Clusters: 4 and silhouette score: 0.31075537274
4. No of Clusters: 5 and silhouette score: 0.286092963541
5. No of Clusters: 6 and silhouette score: 0.278277815278
6. No of Clusters: 7 and silhouette score: 0.237518022486
7. No of Clusters: 8 and silhouette score: 0.315958327305
8. No of Clusters: 9 and silhouette score: 0.303316137792
9. No of Clusters: 10 and silhouette score: 0.297450865924

As can be seen from the above silhouette scores, 3 clusters has the best score.

### Cluster Visualization
Once you've chosen the optimal number of clusters for your clustering algorithm using the scoring metric above, you can now visualize the results by executing the code block below. Note that, for experimentation purposes, you are welcome to adjust the number of clusters for your clustering algorithm to see various visualizations. The final visualization provided should, however, correspond with the optimal number of clusters. 


```python
# Display the results of the clustering from implementation
vs.cluster_results(reduced_data, preds, centers, pca_samples)
```


![png](https://github.com/RajNikhil/dataBlog/blob/gh-pages/assets/CustomerSegmentation/custSeg_53_0.png?raw=true)


### Implementation: Data Recovery
Each cluster present in the visualization above has a central point. These centers (or means) are not specifically data points from the data, but rather the *averages* of all the data points predicted in the respective clusters. For the problem of creating customer segments, a cluster's center point corresponds to *the average customer of that segment*. Since the data is currently reduced in dimension and scaled by a logarithm, we can recover the representative customer spending from these data points by applying the inverse transformations.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Apply the inverse transform to `centers` using `pca.inverse_transform` and assign the new centers to `log_centers`.
 - Apply the inverse function of `np.log` to `log_centers` using `np.exp` and assign the true centers to `true_centers`.



```python
# TODO: Inverse transform the centers
log_centers = pca.inverse_transform(centers)

# TODO: Exponentiate the centers
true_centers = np.exp(log_centers)

# Display the true centers
segments = ['Segment {}'.format(i) for i in range(0,len(centers))]
true_centers = pd.DataFrame(np.round(true_centers), columns = data.keys())
true_centers.index = segments
display(true_centers)
```

### Question 8

* Consider the total purchase cost of each product category for the representative data points above, and reference the statistical description of the dataset at the beginning of this project(specifically looking at the mean values for the various feature points). What set of establishments could each of the customer segments represent?

**Hint:** A customer who is assigned to `'Cluster X'` should best identify with the establishments represented by the feature set of `'Segment X'`. Think about what each segment represents in terms their values for the feature points chosen. Reference these values with the mean values to get some perspective into what kind of establishment they represent.

**Answer:**

*Segment 0:* Customers in Segment 0 higher than average consumption of Milk, Grocery and Detergents_Paper. These customers could be restaurants, cafes, etc.

*Segment 1:* Customers in Segment 1 are considerably lower in average spending in all the food categories. These are the customers could be individuals who purchase from the wholesaler(s) less frequently may be for their small business.

*Segment 2:* Customers in Segment 2 spend higher than other segment customers on Fresh and Frozen. In fact their spend is close to the average of these food categories. These customers could be retailers.

### Question 9

* For each sample point, which customer segment from* **Question 8** *best represents it? 
* Are the predictions for each sample point consistent with this?*

Run the code block below to find which cluster each sample point is predicted to be.


```python
# Display the predictions
for i, pred in enumerate(sample_preds):
    print("Sample point", i, "predicted to be in Cluster", pred)
```

    Sample point 0 predicted to be in Cluster 0
    Sample point 1 predicted to be in Cluster 1
    Sample point 2 predicted to be in Cluster 2
    

**Answer:**

*Sample Customer 1:* This customer was categorized as Segment 2 customer. This does seem like the correct segment for the customer since its spending on Fresh and Frozen categories higher than or closer to average spend by the segment on that category of food.

*Sample Customer 2:* This customer was categorized as Segment 0 customer. This too seems correct based on the customer spending on Milk, Grocery and Detergents_Paper food category.

*Sample Customer 3:* This customer was categorized as Segment 2 customer as well. At first look it might seem odd since this customer spend less than average on categories customers from segment tend to spend. On closer inpection we can see this customer's spending on rest of the categories, which is too low. In essence, this customer's trend of spend on categories is similar to customers from this segment even though the magnitude is smaller. This then seems to be the right segment for this customer.

## Conclusion

In this final section, you will investigate ways that you can make use of the clustered data. First, you will consider how the different groups of customers, the ***customer segments***, may be affected differently by a specific delivery scheme. Next, you will consider how giving a label to each customer (which *segment* that customer belongs to) can provide for additional features about the customer data. Finally, you will compare the ***customer segments*** to a hidden variable present in the data, to see whether the clustering identified certain relationships.

### Question 10
Companies will often run [A/B tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) when making small changes to their products or services to determine whether making that change will affect its customers positively or negatively. The wholesale distributor is considering changing its delivery service from currently 5 days a week to 3 days a week. However, the distributor will only make this change in delivery service for customers that react positively. 

* How can the wholesale distributor use the customer segments to determine which customers, if any, would react positively to the change in delivery service?*

**Hint:** Can we assume the change affects all customers equally? How can we determine which group of customers it affects the most?

**Answer:**

Changes seldom affect all customers in the same way. Some customers might experience disruption, some might experience benefits and others might just be indifferent.

Segment 0 customers spend mostly on Milk, Grocery and Detergents_Paper categories. Grocery and Detergents_Paper can certainly last more than a week. Milk might be the only issue since it requires not just space but also special equipment for controlled temperatures. If the customers have these then Segment 0 customers may not object infact they may find it easier since they have to spend less time on taking deliveries.

Segment 1 customers spend less on all categories compard to other customers from segments but their spend is high in Milk, Fresh and Grocery. Since these seem like smaller businesses given their spending they might not take well to new delivery schedule as they may to reduce their cost where ever possible.

Segment 2 customers spend most on Fresh and Frozen but they also seem to be bigger customers of the wholesaler given their spending. These customers might take it as a disruption or be indifferent to the changes based on how they handle the Fresh products.

If we consider the points mentioned above, it is clear that their reaction to the changes in delivery system is no going be the same. To conduct A/B testing then we have to create control and experiment group within each of these clusters. Creating control and experiment groups within clusters will ensure we are measuring effects of change against similar factors that could be affecting the members of both groups. This will ensure the validity of the experiment results.

### Question 11
Additional structure is derived from originally unlabeled data when using clustering techniques. Since each customer has a ***customer segment*** it best identifies with (depending on the clustering algorithm applied), we can consider *'customer segment'* as an **engineered feature** for the data. Assume the wholesale distributor recently acquired ten new customers and each provided estimates for anticipated annual spending of each product category. Knowing these estimates, the wholesale distributor wants to classify each new customer to a ***customer segment*** to determine the most appropriate delivery service.  
* How can the wholesale distributor label the new customers using only their estimated product spending and the **customer segment** data?

**Hint:** A supervised learner could be used to train on the original customers. What would be the target variable?

**Answer:**

Once we have the clustering for existing customers, we can use it as a training and validation dataset with any of the classification algorithms such as SVM, Decision Trees. 

The target variable for these classification algorithms would be the segment.

### Visualizing Underlying Distributions

At the beginning of this project, it was discussed that the `'Channel'` and `'Region'` features would be excluded from the dataset so that the customer product categories were emphasized in the analysis. By reintroducing the `'Channel'` feature to the dataset, an interesting structure emerges when considering the same PCA dimensionality reduction applied earlier to the original dataset.

Run the code block below to see how each data point is labeled either `'HoReCa'` (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe) or `'Retail'` the reduced space. In addition, you will find the sample points are circled in the plot, which will identify their labeling.


```python
# Display the clustering results based on 'Channel' data
vs.channel_results(reduced_data, outliers, pca_samples)
```


![png](https://github.com/RajNikhil/dataBlog/blob/gh-pages/assets/CustomerSegmentation/custSeg_68_0.png?raw=true)


### Question 12

* How well does the clustering algorithm and number of clusters you've chosen compare to this underlying distribution of Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers to Retailer customers? 
* Are there customer segments that would be classified as purely 'Retailers' or 'Hotels/Restaurants/Cafes' by this distribution? 
* Would you consider these classifications as consistent with your previous definition of the customer segments?

**Answer:**

Based on the Silhouette Score for different cluster numbers, I used 3 clusters since it had the highest Silhouette score. This doesn't exactly fit well with the two clusters one each for Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe and Retail segments.

Segment 1 and Segment 2 can be considered purely Retailer and Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe respectively as the centers/means are located well within the points that are classified as beloging to their respective class and these centers are also far away from each other which makes it easy to say this clustering is good.

In the initial definition I mentioned three types of customers based on the sample I had selected. The GMM gave me highest Silhouette score for 3 clusters. So this is consistent with my initial assumption. 

The initial definitions of these customer segments also line up with the results of the cluster means.
